## Advancing environmental DNA (eDNA) as a national standardized biomonitoring tool in three oceans, including to support Canada’s Marine Protected Areas (MPA) Program

Canada has committed to the global effort to reduce biodiversity loss through ecosystem-based management, Oceans Protection Plan (OPP) initiatives in partnership with indigenous stakeholders, provision of science to support international commitments (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity [1]; Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) biodiversity and Arctic Invasive Alien Species Strategy), and investments in MPAs and MPA networks. Since 2016, Canada has endeavored on an ambitious expansion of MPAs, moving from <1% (55,000 km<sup>2</sup>) in 2016 to 10% (~570,000 km<sup>2</sup>) by 2020.
Addressing these commitments, including measuring MPA network effectiveness, will require intensive ocean monitoring at unprecedented scales. Traditional marine survey methods rely on direct sampling and are often spatially restricted, taxon-specific, costly, difficult to calibrate, and in some cases destructive; thus are limited in their ability to capture large spatial and temporal complexity in marine systems. These limitations, and DFO’s mandate to monitor the expanding Canadian MPA network, as well as other biodiversity conservation initiatives, necessitate innovative approaches to measuring marine diversity.

Here, we propose to evaluate an indirect, synoptic, and cost-efficient eDNA metabarcoding approach as a potential tool for marine biodiversity monitoring, with specific applications to the Canadian MPA network and other initiatives (e.g., OPP). We will develop a nationally-standardized eDNA metabarcoding protocol that will be tested in three of Canada’s ocean systems. We will examine spatial and temporal dynamics of diversity revealed through eDNA in water samples and will directly compare results to those obtained by traditional survey methods.
